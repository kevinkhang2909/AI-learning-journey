# AI learning journey
"What I cannot create, I do not understand", as Feynman said. So I build this repository. You will find tutorials 
and projects related to Machine Learning. I try to make the code as concise as possible, and the goal is be to 
used as a learning resource and a way to lookup problems to solve specific problems.
